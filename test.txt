Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key.

    Start the ssh-agent in the background.

    $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    > Agent pid 59566

    Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.
